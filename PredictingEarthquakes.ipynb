    "A time series is a sequence of values observed over time and, therefore, chronologically ordered. Given this definition, it is usual to find data that can be represented as time series in many research fields.\n",
    "The study of the past behavior of a variable may be extremely valuable to\n",
    "predict its future behavior. Assuming that the nature of the earthquakes time\n",
    "series is stochastic, clustering techniques have shown that these time series exhibit some temporal patterns, making the modeling and subsequent prediction\n",
    "possible [11].\n",
    "This paper analyzes and forecasts earthquakes time series by means of the\n",
    "application of two classical techniques: Quantitative association rules (QAR)\n",
    "and regression.\n",
    "A revision of the latest published works reveals that the amount of metaheuristics and search algorithms related to association rules with continuous\n",
    "attributes is limited. Nevertheless, a classifier was presented in [13] to extract\n",
    "quantitative association rules from unlabeled data streams. The main\n",
    "noveltyof this approach lied on its adaptability to on-line gathered data. Also, a metaheuristic based on rough particle swarm techniques was presented in [1]. In this\n",
    "case, the special feature was the obtention of the values determining the intervals\n",
    "of the association rules. They also evaluated and tested several new operators in\n",
    "synthetic data. A multi-objective pareto-based genetic algorithm was presented\n",
    "in [2]. The fitness function was formed by four different objectives: support,\n",
    "confidence, comprehensibility of the rule (aimed at being maximized) and the\n",
    "amplitude of the intervals that forms the rule (intended to be minimized). The\n",
    "work published in [17] presented a new approach based on three novel algorithms: Value-interval clustering, interval-interval clustering and matrix-interval\n",
    "clustering. Their application was found especially useful when mining complex\n",
    "information. Another genetic algorithm was used in [16] in order to obtain numeric association rules. However, the unique objective to be optimized in the\n",
    "fitness function was the confidence. To fulfill this goal, the authors avoided the\n",
    "specification of the actual minimum support, which is the main contribution of\n",
    "this work. Finally, an extension of the well-known binary-coded CHC algorithm\n",
    "is presented in [10] for finding existing relations between atmospheric pollution\n",
    "and climatological conditions.\n",
    "Regression techniques have been widely used for forecasting time series [5].\n",
    "Thus, an empirical study on sea water quality prediction can be found in [7].\n",
    "Hatzikos et al. faced the problem of forecasting water quality based on underwater sensors measurements, by means of a large variety of both linear and nonlinear methods. Also, a new methodology to build regression trees was introduced\n",
    "in [3]. The authors transformed quantitative data into statistical moments, and\n",
    "constructed a tree to estimate the forecasting interval of the target variable.\n",
    "Last, the problem of predicting the machinery degradation and trending of fault\n",
    "propagation before reaching the alarm was studied in [12]. In particular, the\n",
